# Predictive-Analytics---Vehicle-Mileage-Prediction-using-Python
Predicting mileage of cars using its features. A supervised learning problem.

In this file, I will be demonstrating an end-to-end machine learning project on Automobile dataset. I have taken data from UCI Repository.

I will start from loading data from the repository into pandas dataframe. Then, I will perform basic data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to study the characterstics of dataset. Finally, I will scale the features, split it into test and train datasets and perform a multiple linear regression to predict the mileage of a vehicle in city based on various predictors.
